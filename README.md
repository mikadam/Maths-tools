#Math tools

######Collection of tools I wrote to help me with repetitive math/physics on highschool homework

![function_tools](https://github.com/mikadam/Maths-tools/blob/master/function_tools.png)

`function_tools.py` is a small UI program for dealing function manipulation. Numerically finds roots and symbolically finds derivatives and sometimes integrals (but only simple ones). `parsers.py` is there the actually interesting symbolic manipulation happens

![ODE](https://github.com/mikadam/Maths-tools/blob/master/ode.png)

`ODE_solver.py` is a graphical user interface for Euler's method for integrating differential equations. It also has a mode to solve and plot coupled equations. It uses `parsers_for_solver.py` and `maths_for_solver.py`
